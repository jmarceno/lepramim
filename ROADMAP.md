## v0.4.0

Remaining items and new work.

- **Spike 1** — per-application capture compatibility matrix on real hardware
- **Fedora 41 VM smoke test** — documented + CI job (if feasible)
- **Codecov integration** — line/branch coverage reporting

## v0.4.0+

Speculative. Please file a discussion if you'd like to work on any of
these.

- **Karaoke word-level highlighting** — forced-align Kokoro output against
  the input text and highlight the currently-spoken word in the floating
  overlay
- **Browser extension** — page-level selection bridge for Firefox and
  Chromium that doesn't depend on the PRIMARY selection protocol
- **Additional providers** — Piper (CPU-friendly), Chatterbox, other
  local neural TTS backends
- **Flatpak / Snap / AppImage / AUR / COPR** packaging — assuming
  maintainer volunteers
- **PDF reading mode** — direct PDF input, sentence-by-sentence navigation

## Explicitly NOT on the roadmap

- Cloud TTS (Google, Azure, OpenAI, ElevenLabs) — Lexaloud is a
  privacy-first local tool
- Telemetry, usage statistics, crash reporting — see the privacy
  paragraph in README.md
- Mobile (Android, iOS) — Linux desktop only
- Windows or macOS — Linux only
