"""Model artifact download/verify + ONNX Runtime environment guard.

Pinned URLs + SHA256 hashes come from Spike 0 (see `spikes/spike0_results.md`).

Two jobs:

1. `ensure_artifacts(cache_dir)` — make sure the Kokoro ONNX model and voices
   pack are present and hash-verified. Downloads missing files to a
   `.partial` staging path and renames on success; unlinks the partial on
   any error so a failed download doesn't leave stale bytes behind.

2. `assert_onnxruntime_environment()` — detect the known-broken states where
   - both `onnxruntime` and `onnxruntime-gpu` (or other variants) are
     installed in the same venv, and
   - the shared `onnxruntime/` directory has been corrupted by a
     `pip uninstall onnxruntime` that also ripped out files shared with
     `onnxruntime-gpu`.

   Spike 0 demonstrated both failure modes on the target Ubuntu 24.04 +
   RTX 5080 box.
