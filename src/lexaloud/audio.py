"""AudioSink protocol and three implementations.

The sink does not assume a single fixed sample rate for its lifetime; sample
rate is established per stream via `begin_stream(sr, channels)`.

`SoundDeviceSink` lazily opens the sounddevice output stream — daemon startup
must not require a working audio device.
