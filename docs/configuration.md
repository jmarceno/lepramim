# Configuration

Lexaloud reads `~/.config/lexaloud/config.toml` (or
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/lexaloud/config.toml`) at daemon startup. An example
file lives at [`src/lexaloud/templates/config.example.toml`](../src/lexaloud/templates/config.example.toml);
copy it and edit to taste. The daemon must be restarted after any
config change.

```bash
cp src/lexaloud/templates/config.example.toml ~/.config/lexaloud/config.toml
# edit ~/.config/lexaloud/config.toml
systemctl --user restart lexaloud.service
```

## Sections

### `[capture]`

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `max_bytes` | `204800` | Maximum selection size in bytes. Larger selections are truncated on a UTF-8 boundary. |
| `subprocess_timeout_s` | `2.0` | Timeout for `wl-paste`/`xclip`/`xsel` subprocess calls. |

### `[daemon]`

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `host` | `"127.0.0.1"` | **Deprecated.** The daemon binds a Unix domain socket at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/lexaloud/lexaloud.sock`. Kept for forward compat; ignored at runtime. Will be removed in v0.3. |
| `port` | `5487` | **Deprecated.** Same as `host`. Will be removed in v0.3. |
| `ready_queue_depth` | `3` | Max completed sentence chunks buffered between the provider and the audio sink. Bounds memory during pause or slow playback. Increase to 5-10 if you hear audible gaps between sentences on a slower CPU. |

### `[provider]`

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `voice` | `"af_heart"` | Any Kokoro v1.0 voice. The control window lists the full bundled catalog. |
| `lang` | `"en-us"` | Phonemizer language code. The control window lists every language represented by the bundled voices. |
| `speed` | `1.0` | Playback speed multiplier. Safe range for dense academic prose is 0.85-1.3. The control window slider enforces 0.5-2.0. |

### `[preprocessor]`

Stages run in the listed order. `dedupe_mathjax_selection` and
`strip_markdown` are structural cleanup passes that must run before any
character-substitution stage, so their ordering is fixed.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `dedupe_mathjax_selection` | `true` | Deduplicate math captured from rendered MathJax/KaTeX pages. When you select text on such a page, the browser captures each expression twice (stacked one-char-per-line + compact) with U+200B zero-width spaces between; this detector removes the stacked copy. No-op on non-MathJax input. |
| `strip_markdown` | `true` | Convert markdown formatting (headings, lists, emphasis, tables, code blocks, links, images) into flowing prose. Code blocks are announced as `"Code block omitted."` by default; links show only their text. Uses `markdown-it-py` for CommonMark-compliant parsing. Fast-path no-op when the input has no markdown markers. **The detection heuristic is deliberately conservative** — it fires only when at least one block-level marker (heading, list, blockquote, fence, rule, table), a balanced `**bold**` / `~~strike~~` pair, a link/image, or an HTML tag is present. Inline-only emphasis like `*word*`, `_word_`, and inline backticks `` `x` `` are NOT enough to trigger parsing, because that would silently corrupt technical prose such as `a*b*c`, `__init__`, or `` `print(x)` `` mentions. The cost is that short prose with only single-asterisk emphasis keeps its markers intact — those may be read literally by Kokoro, depending on the voice and surrounding context. Add any block marker to trip the parser if that matters. |
| `strip_numeric_bracket_citations` | `true` | Strip `[3]` or `[1-4]` style citations. Only fires when the `[` is at the start of the text OR preceded by whitespace / sentence-punctuation — so `arr[3]`, `m.group(0)[3]`, and regex literals like `r"[0-9]"` are left alone. **Residual**: standalone bracket-list literals after whitespace (e.g. `x = [1, 2, 3]`) still get stripped because they're indistinguishable from a citation cluster. Set to `false` if reading code-heavy math. |
| `strip_parenthetical_citations` | `false` | Strip `(Smith 2023)` style citations. Off by default because it can over-match ordinary parentheticals. |
| `expand_latin_abbreviations` | `true` | Expand `i.e.`, `e.g.`, `etc.` to full forms. |
| `expand_academic_abbreviations` | `true` | Expand `Fig.`, `Eq.`, `Sec.`, `Thm.`, `w.r.t.`, `i.i.d.`, etc. to full forms. Helps pysbd sentence splitting and TTS pronunciation. |
| `normalize_numbers` | `true` | Convert numbers to spoken English: ordinals (`1st` -> first), cardinals with commas (`1,234`), decimals, percentages, currency, years. Numbers after reference words (Figure 3, Section 2.1) are left as digits. IP addresses, version strings, and phone numbers are protected. |
| `normalize_urls` | `true` | Replace URLs with "link to [domain]" and email addresses with "[name] at [domain]". Markdown links `[text](url)` are replaced with just the link text. |
| `normalize_math_symbols` | `true` | Expand Unicode math symbols to spoken words: Greek letters (alpha-omega), relational operators (less than or equal to), set theory symbols, arrows, superscript digits (squared, cubed). ASCII operators (`<=`, `->`, `!=`) are NOT expanded. |
| `pdf_cleanup` | `true` | Handle line-break hyphenation and other PDF paste artifacts. |

### `[advanced]`

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `overlay` | `false` | Show the floating overlay when speaking. The overlay is an always-on-top sentence caption bar. Enable via `overlay = true` under `[advanced]` or from the control window's Settings tab. |

### `[sre_latex]`

LaTeX-to-speech via [Speech Rule Engine](https://github.com/Speech-Rule-Engine/speech-rule-engine)
(Apache-2.0, the engine behind MathJax). **Off by default.** Requires:

1. Node.js ≥18 installed by your distro's package manager
2. `./scripts/install.sh --with-math-speech` — installs
   `speech-rule-engine@4.1.3` under `~/.local/share/lexaloud/sre/`
   and symlinks `sre` into the venv's `bin/`

Recognized LaTeX delimiters: `$...$`, `$$...$$`, `\(...\)`, `\[...\]`,
and the math environments `equation`, `align`, `gather`, `multline`,
`eqnarray` (and their starred variants).

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `false` | Master switch. Gracefully no-ops when `sre` is not resolvable. |
| `timeout_s` | `10.0` | Per-span subprocess timeout. On timeout the whole text returns unchanged (deterministic fallback). |
| `domain` | `"clearspeak"` | `"clearspeak"` produces natural prose ("a over b"); `"mathspeak"` is more verbose ("StartFraction a Over b EndFraction"). |
| `style` | `""` | Optional style within the domain. Empty string omits the `-s` flag so SRE uses its default. Try `"verbose"` or `"short"` for `clearspeak`. |

Full walkthrough: [`docs/install/math-speech.md`](install/math-speech.md).

### `[normalizer]`

LLM-based text normalization for edge cases the rule-based pipeline
can't handle (complex math, domain-specific acronyms, OCR artifacts,
tables). **Off by default.** Requires:

1. Install the optional dependency: `pip install lexaloud[llm]`
2. Download the model: `lexaloud download-models --llm`

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `false` | Enable LLM text normalization. This separately configured advanced feature is available through `config.toml`. |
| `model_path` | `""` | Absolute path to a GGUF model file. Empty = auto-detect in `~/.cache/lexaloud/models/`. |
| `model_repo` | `"Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct-GGUF"` | HuggingFace repository for the default model. |
| `model_file` | `"qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf"` | Filename within the repository. |
| `n_gpu_layers` | `-1` | Number of model layers to offload to GPU. `-1` = all layers (recommended). Set `0` for CPU-only inference. |
| `n_ctx` | `4096` | Context window size in tokens. |
| `temperature` | `0.0` | Sampling temperature. `0.0` = greedy/deterministic (recommended for normalization). |
| `max_output_ratio` | `1.5` | Maximum output tokens = input tokens x this ratio. Prevents runaway generation. |

#### `[normalizer.glossary]`

User-defined acronym expansions applied **deterministically before** the
LLM runs. Each key is matched as a whole word; the value is the spoken
replacement. This is the most reliable way to handle domain-specific
acronyms.

```toml
[normalizer.glossary]
MAPPO = "Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization"
GCBF = "Graph Control Barrier Function"
CBF = "Control Barrier Function"
```

#### VRAM usage

The default model (Qwen2.5-1.5B Q4_K_M) uses ~1.2 GB VRAM. Combined
with Kokoro-82M (~500 MB), total GPU memory usage is ~1.7 GB. This fits
comfortably on any 8 GB+ GPU.

Set `n_gpu_layers = 0` to run the LLM on CPU only (slower but no
additional VRAM usage).

## Voice selection

The control window (`lexaloud-control` or the tray menu → Control
window…) offers the complete bundled Kokoro voice catalog. Any string
the installed voices pack recognizes also works in `config.toml`.

## Speed guidance

| Speed | Experience |
|-------|------------|
| `0.5` – `0.84` | Slow. Can feel dragged. Good for non-native listeners or very dense material. |
| `0.85` – `1.00` | Natural. |
| `1.00` – `1.30` | Faster than natural. Safe range for reading-along when you're already familiar with the domain. |
| `1.30` – `1.50` | Risky on unfamiliar material. Comprehension drops. |
| `> 1.50` | Very risky. Useful for skimming, not reading. |

## Hot-reloading

The daemon does not hot-reload `config.toml`. Restart via:

```bash
systemctl --user restart lexaloud.service
```

The control window's "Apply settings" button restarts app-managed
playback so the saved settings take effect immediately.
